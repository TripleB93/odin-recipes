    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This is a delicious recipe that I cook when I need a fast lunch. 
        All you need is instant ramen, chicken thighs, and some seasoning.
        You can have the whole thing finished in 20 minutes, and less than 10
        if you pre-cook the chicken thighs the night before. Egg and dried
        seaweed can be added as a bonus to elevate the dish, but it is not 
        necessary.
